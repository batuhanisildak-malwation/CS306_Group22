## Project Description
This database has been designed to manage and store data related to different aspects of
countries and their environmental aspects, including population statistics, pollution, renewable energy
sources, and causes of death. Main aim of this project is to promote awareness on some of the current
global disasters by creating a database which has the capability of holding data about countries' death
causes and pollution while classifying population into different generations. In addition, usage of
renewable energy sources is also stored, which can give a deeper insight on how these energy sources
can play a role in countries' mortality rates & causes. 

## Repository Description
